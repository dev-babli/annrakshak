# Intelligent Pesticide Sprinkling System - Research & Architecture

## Problem Analysis

### Current Challenges in Agriculture
1. **Over-application of Pesticides**: 30-50% of pesticides are wasted due to uniform spraying
2. **Environmental Impact**: 
   - Soil degradation affects 33% of global land
   - Water contamination impacts 40% of water bodies near farms
   - Beneficial insects (bees, ladybugs) declining by 40%
3. **Economic Loss**: Farmers spend $45 billion annually on excess pesticides
4. **Health Risks**: 200,000+ deaths annually from pesticide poisoning

### Technical Solutions Research
